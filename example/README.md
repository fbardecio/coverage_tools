## Description

This is an example project for demonstrating how to use the `run_all_coverage` script.

This script takes care of running the tests and generating the coverage report for the `lib` folder and for each package under the packages folder.
For this example app, the tests will be run for the `lib` folder and for the `form_inputs` and `storage` packages.
After running the tests, the script will generate the coverage report for the aforementioned folders and packages, and will update the `README.md` file with the coverage badges and the percentage of coverage for each folder and package.
Finally it will open the `lib` folder coverage report on the browser.

*Note:* The total coverage percentage is calculated by summing the total lines of code and the total covered lines of code for all the folders and packages.

:red_circle: **Important**: This package requires that the `README.md` file contains the following texts, without the `/` at the beginning, we are adding the `/` to avoid the coverage script adding the coverage badges under this line:
```
/<!-- coverage::ignore -->

...Badges

<!-- end-coverage:ignore -->
```
By having these texts, the script will be able to update the coverage badges in the `README.md` file.

## Usage
These are the steps needed in order to run the `run_all_coverage` script:

1 - Install lcov ([lcov](https://github.com/linux-test-project/lcov)):
```brew install lcov```

2 - Install lcov-to-badge-cli globally:
```npm install lcov2badge```

3 - Copy the `run_all_coverage.sh` script to the root of your project.


4 - Run `run_all_coverage.sh` script:
```sh run_all_coverage.sh```

5 - Optionally, add these folders to the `.gitignore` file:
```
# Coverage
coverage/
packages/*/coverage/

# Node modules
node_modules/
package-lock.json
package.json
```



:tada: **Congratulations!** The coverage report has been generated and the `README.md` file has been updated with the coverage badges and the percentage of coverage for each folder and package.
